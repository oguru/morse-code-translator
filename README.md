# Morse Code Translator

## Description
The first small scale app I created, part of a challenge to help consolidate interacting with Objects in Javascript.\
The aim was to translate from words to Morse code which I completed and then extended by allowing translation in the other direction.

## Still To Do
* I am planning on making the UI more interesting by experimenting with Html Canvas.

## Setup
1 - Clone the repository.\
2 - Open index.html in your browser.


## Built Using
Html\
Sass\
Javascript
